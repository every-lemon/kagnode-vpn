# Optional KagNode Account profiles

Sign in to the application locally, then open Account/Settings preferences and choose Link KagNode Account. Open the displayed KagNode address, compare the code and approve the specific installation. New explicit consent shares your display name, stable profile identifier, photo and optionally a verified contact email. Existing profile-only grants remain unchanged. Passwords, mailbox access, vault encryption and local administrator roles stay separate. Accounts are never matched automatically by email.

A local administrator can turn sync off for the whole installation. This clears local profile links and stops profile requests. Users retain local sign-in. Remote revocations are attempted with a bounded request; failed disconnections remain in a private retry queue visible to local administration. Turning sync back on requires each user to link again. You can also revoke a connection in KagNode Account → Connections → Self-hosted applications.

Set KAGNODE_ACCOUNT_SYNC=off in the server's process environment to enforce disabled mode. Set KAGNODE_ACCOUNT_ISSUER to the exact HTTPS KagNode Account origin when migrating domains. Changing issuer clears old links and disables sync until a local administrator re-enables it; old tokens are never sent to the new origin. Settings profile linking keeps its short-lived code confirmation. Browser sign-in uses the exact callback described below, without adding an incoming port or sharing an application secret.

Local applications store refresh credentials only in private server-side storage. The browser receives profile data and a user code, never a KagNode access/refresh token. Polling is bounded, refreshes are serialized, profile refresh occurs at most once per fifteen minutes per link, and offline errors keep local accounts available. Only still WebP profile photos are accepted by the connection UI.

Mail administrators use the existing local administrator confirmation. Authenticator assigns profile-sync administration to the retained legacy vault owner, or the first local account when there is no migrated owner; KAGNODE_ACCOUNT_ADMIN can specify a local account ID. This permission does not grant access to other encrypted vaults. VPN's local owner controls installation policy; HTTP Boot's private console credential controls its administrator profile. CLI is controlled by its local operating-system owner using `kagnode account sync on|off|status`; its existing account sign-in supplies the profile, and its browser examples provide the same preference.

The new issuer endpoints are POST /api/v1/account-sync/device, POST /api/v1/account-sync/token, GET /api/v1/account-sync/profile?client_id=PROJECT and POST /api/v1/account-sync/revoke. They must exist on the configured KagNode Account server before linking succeeds. Local web controls use the app's existing session/CSRF mechanisms; Media versions them under /api/v1/kagnode-account.

The profile and sign-in checks use isolated local-account and issuer fixtures; no production account approval is part of the tests. Packaging does not deploy the updated KagNode Account server, application servers or any native service. Logos and the downloaded artwork viewer remain account-free.

## Connection recovery

A pending connection keeps its confirmation code and remaining lifetime after reloading the page or reopening the server-side store. Only that local account can read its pending confirmation details; device and profile credentials are never returned to the browser. Cancel linking stops the current attempt without disconnecting an established profile. If another tab has started a newer attempt, a stale cancellation is rejected.

The panel shows retry controls for failed loads and ignores late responses after a newer action. If issued credentials must be discarded while KagNode is unreachable, their revocation stays in the private retry queue. Local administrators can retry those disconnections from installation settings. Local sign-in, permissions and stored application data remain independent.

Profile errors retain their conflict/expiry status through the private control broker. Profile RPC calls allow up to 30 seconds for the bounded token/profile/cleanup exchange; other RPC calls retain their five-second default. A broker outage returns retryable JSON. Native VPN provisioning and tunnel settings are unchanged.

## Application update recovery

The local-administration update panel shows recovery details and metadata filenames returned by KagNode CLI. Recovery, an active local operation or `can_apply: false` prevents an install action. A release check may replace a damaged candidate cache; installation state and operation records require administrator review rather than automatic deletion. New managers supply lock-backed `in_progress`; older managers retain phase-based display compatibility. Ordinary users receive no update controls.

## Login with KagNode

The shared Core sign-in frame keeps the application’s local form. Login with KagNode redirects the same tab to the configured KagNode issuer and returns to this application after approval. A fresh browser-bound request uses independent random state, nonce and an S256 PKCE verifier. No confirmation code needs to be copied. Compare the installation and requested permissions on KagNode before approving. A profile refresh is not a sign-in proof. The server checks the approved issuer, immutable subject, client, installation, purpose, nonce, timestamps and local policy before continuing.

New consent can include `profile.read email.read`: display name, photo and a currently verified contact email. Existing profile-only grants do not gain email access. The contact email is a profile display field; existing local login names, mailbox addresses, permissions and encrypted data are not silently changed. Accounts are never merged by matching email.

VPN admits only an existing enabled, enrolled local administrator already linked to the verified KagNode subject. The local authenticator or recovery code remains mandatory. There is no public administrator signup, automatic approval, or role inferred from KagNode claims.

A local administrator can disable profile synchronization and provider sign-in. Local sign-in remains available without KagNode, including when the issuer is offline. Cancel, expiry, policy changes and concurrent attempts cannot authorize a stale browser result. Anonymous attempts are bounded by expiry, one active attempt per browser, a global pool limit and start-rate limits. The callback claims an attempt atomically; an ambiguous token exchange must be restarted instead of replayed. The separate settings profile-link flow retains its existing bounded device-code confirmation.

Provider access/refresh credentials stay in private server storage. The browser receives only an issuer authorization address, a short-lived opaque attempt identifier and the application’s own continuation/session. The PKCE verifier and provider access/refresh credentials remain private on the application server. Anonymous CSRF state is bound to the browser; Python applications persist the CSRF signing secret privately so multiple workers and restarts agree. Do not delete the profile database during an update. Back up it alongside existing application data, preserve ownership and permissions, and retain the previous source for rollback.

The issuer must support `POST /api/v1/account-sync/browser/start`, the `authorization_code` token grant, `/browser/cancel`, fresh authorization proofs and consented verified-email scope. An older issuer fails closed, while local sign-in remains available. The existing installation origin is the callback origin; HTTPS is required for public hosts, with private literal-IP/loopback HTTP installations allowed by issuer policy. The fixed path is `/auth/kagnode/callback` (`/manage/auth/kagnode/callback` for VPN). No extra listening port is opened.

Callbacks require the initiating browser cookie, exact state and the configured `iss` value on both approval and denial. Missing, duplicate or mismatched parameters do not exchange a code. The temporary sign-in cookie allows a top-level cross-site GET return; authenticated session cookies and mutation CSRF checks keep their existing protection. Responses are `no-store` and `no-referrer`, and redirect to the app with only a bound local continuation identifier. Core removes that identifier before resuming. Configure reverse-proxy access logs to omit callback query strings.

The profile database migration only adds sign-in attempt columns and an index. Keep its original permissions and preserve it alongside the application database; do not replace either during a web update. Core assets and the fallback are locally served. A compatible Core UI patch does not authorize replacing the application backend, its SDK or native services.

Protocol references: [S256 PKCE, RFC 7636](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7636.html), [issuer identification, RFC 9207](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9207.html), and [OAuth security guidance, RFC 9700](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9700.html). These controls are tested implementation behavior, not a claim of certification.

HTTPS sign-in uses a dedicated `__Host-` browser-return cookie (Secure, HttpOnly,
SameSite=Lax, Path=/, no Domain). An unprefixed or duplicate cookie is not accepted
as that binding. Local HTTP development uses a separate unprefixed cookie; keep
it limited to the explicitly supported private/loopback installation.
